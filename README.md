# farmer_johns_botanicals

A Flutter e-commerce app for Farmer John's Botanicals.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Development

### Running in Development Mode (with Hot Reload)

To see code changes immediately without restarting the terminal, run:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

or for web server mode:

```bash
flutter run -d web-server
```

**Hot Reload Shortcuts:**
- Press `r` in the terminal for **Hot Reload** - instantly reloads code changes
- Press `R` in the terminal for **Hot Restart** - restarts the app (faster than full restart)
- Press `q` to quit the app

**Important:** Use `flutter run` for development, NOT `flutter build web`. The build command creates production files that don't support hot reload.

### Production Build

For production deployment, use:

```bash
flutter build web
```

This creates optimized files in the `build/web` directory.
